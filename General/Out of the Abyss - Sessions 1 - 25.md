## What is OotA?
*Out of the Abyss* is a survival/horror campaign where the players try to escape captivity from the Drow, a dark-elf race that dwells in the Underdark.

Besides escaping servitude, they are also forced to confront the escalating chaos caused by the demons spilling from the Abyss.

It took our players through various civilizations, demon lords, dangerous creatures, friendly faces. The following summary will focus on part 1. 

## Part 1 Summary

### Prisoners of the Drow

![[ooa01-01.png]]

As night falls, and the last bit of sun is swallowed by the moon, we see the Drow, a dark elf race, kidnapping various people and forcing them into moving cages. Among this group we find [[Lurris Dreambow]], who has been taken on purpose in pursuit of someone that was also taken in a similar fashion -- his sister, [[Belinda Tremorbow]]. 

After being unconscious from drow poison, [[Lurris Dreambow]] finds himself in a cell...collared and shackled. There are others around him as well, that in some fashion or another, ended up in the same position. It is here we meet our other players that have been in the Slave Pen a few days already. The first of which is [[Urimos Tusk]]. Over a period of a couple of days, we meet the rest of the party - [[Erxus]], [[Grumpy]], [[Zebu]], and others. 

>[!info] Description of the Cave and Captors
>Captured by the drow! You wouldn’t wish this fate upon anyone, yet here you are — locked in a dark cave, the cold, heavy weight of metal tight around your throat and wrists. You are not alone. Other prisoners are trapped in here with you, in an underground outpost far from the light of the sun. Your captors include a cruel drow priestess who calls herself Mistress Ilvara of House Mizzrym. Over the past several days, you’ve met her several times, robed in silken garments and flanked by two male drow, one of whom has a mass of scars along one side of his face and neck. Mistress Ilvara likes to impress her will with scourge in hand and remind you that your life now belongs to her. “Accept your fate, learn to obey, and you may survive.” Her words echo in your memory, even as you plot your escape.
