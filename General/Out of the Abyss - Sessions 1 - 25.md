## What is OotA?
*Out of the Abyss* is a survival/horror campaign where the players try to escape captivity from the Drow, a dark-elf race that dwells in the Underdark. While players try to escape this subterranean world, they quickly realize just how grim and bereft their situation is. Besides escaping servitude, they are also forced to confront the escalating chaos caused by the demons spilling from the Abyss. 

### Part 1
This campaign is divided into 2 parts, Escape from Captivity and Confronting the Demon Lords. The first 25 sessions were all about Escaping from Captivity. It took our players through various civilizations, demon lords, dangerous creatures, friendly faces. The following summary will focus on part 1. 

## Part 1 Summary

### Session 1 - Prisoners of the Drow

![[ooa01-01.png]]

As night falls, and the last bit of sun is swallowed by the moon, we see the Drow, a dark elf race, kidnapping various people and forcing them into moving cages. Among this group we find [[Lurrus Dreambow]], who has been taken on purpose in pursuit of someone that was also taken in a similar fashion -- his sister, [[Belinda Tremorbow]]. 

After being unconscious from drow poison, [[Lurrus Dreambow]] finds himself in a cell...collared and shackled. There are others around him as well, that in some fashion or another, ended up in the same position. It is here we meet our other players that have been in the Slave Pen a few days already. The first of which is [[Urimos Tusk]]. Over a period of a couple of days, we meet the rest of the party - [[Erxus]], [[Grumpy]], [[Zebu]], and others. 

>[!info] Description of the Cave and Captors
>Captured by the drow! You wouldn’t wish this fate upon anyone, yet here you are — locked in a dark cave, the cold, heavy weight of metal tight around your throat and wrists. You are not alone. Other prisoners are trapped in here with you, in an underground outpost far from the light of the sun. Your captors include a cruel drow priestess who calls herself Mistress Ilvara of House Mizzrym. Over the past several days, you’ve met her several times, robed in silken garments and flanked by two male drow, one of whom has a mass of scars along one side of his face and neck. Mistress Ilvara likes to impress her will with scourge in hand and remind you that your life now belongs to her. “Accept your fate, learn to obey, and you may survive.” Her words echo in your memory, even as you plot your escape.

#### The Slave Pen
The slave pen in which the prisoners are held is closed with a heavy iron gate bolted into the stone. Players soon realized as well that there are powerful wards that prevent spell-casters from trying to do any magic...There is also a clay pot shared amongst prisoners for their bathroom that is emptied once a day. 

There are also other prisoners that our players meet.

![[01-03.png]]

>[!warning] [[Lurrus Dreambow]] gets punched
>Lurrus was fucking around too much and [[Ilvara Mizzrym]] gets punched in the face...with enough force to let him know she's dangerous. 

#### Information We Learn About

As the days go by, the players learn various things regarding where they are, the drow in charge, and various other bits of information about their situation. 

##### The Drow

We are in a place called [[Velkynvelve]] within the underdark. The garrison here consists of 12 [drow](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17133-drow), five [drow elite warriors](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17134-drow-elite-warrior), a junior drow priestess named [Asha](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/273441-asha-vandree) (use the [priest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16985-priest) - [[Asha Vandree]] stat block in the Monster Manual, but add the Fey Ancestry, Innate Spellcasting, and Sunlight Sensitivity features of the [drow](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17133-drow) stat block), and the outpost’s commander, a senior [drow priestess of Lolth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17136-drow-priestess-of-lolth) named [[Ilvara Mizzrym]]. 

|   |   |
|---|---|
|[[Ilvara Mizzrym]]|Drow priestess and commander of the outpost|
|[[Asha Vandree]]|Junior priestess|
|[[Shoor Vandree]]|Drow elite warrior. Ilvara’s lieutenant and lover, and Asha’s distant cousin|
|[[Jorlan Duskryn]]|Maimed drow elite warrior. Ilvara’s former lieutenant and lover.|

Prisoners are awaiting for transport to [[Menzoberranzan]].

>[!info] Roleplaying the Drow
>The drow are arrogant, cruel, and vicious, viewing their slaves as little more than livestock and treating them with cold disregard. Even the lowest drow understands the inferiority of other creatures, behaving toward the prisoners like sneering nobility. With their superiors, however, the drow are fawning sycophants with a passive-aggressive edge. The males defer to the females, the rank-and-file warriors defer to the elite warriors, and everyone defers to the priestess Ilvara.

##### What prisoners know

- There are nineteen drow at the outpost, including Ilvara, Shoor, and Jorlan, as well as another priestess named Asha. There are also a dozen quaggoths and a number of giant spiders.
- Three drow guards watch the slave pen from the hanging guard tower across the rope bridge, visible through the locked gate.
- The cell has some sort of antimagic effect on it (see area 11 for details).
- Jorlan the drow warrior suffered disfiguring injuries recently. Before then, he seemed more in Ilvara’s favor. Now Shoor seems to have displaced him.
- Jorlan used to have a wand that shot globs of sticky material able to trap targets. Now Shoor carries it, as another sign of their change in status.
- It might be a matter of days or tendays before a contingent from Menzoberranzan arrives to take prisoners back to the drow city.

Additionally, the drow [[Sarith Kzekarit]] knows the following:

- A gray ooze lives in the pool. It’s harmless, feeding off waste unless disturbed.
- A supply patrol from [[Menzoberranzan]] is a few days overdue, which is unusual.

##### Hard Labor

- cleaning toilets
- work a third of the day, suppervised by quaggoths
- stacking rocks
- coiling ropes
- pointless tasks for amusement

#### Back to our Players

[[Grumpy]] takes out some thief tools from an even darker place than the Underdark to try and unlock some of the chains. [[Zebu]] was the one that retrieved the tools from there...

>[!warning] Jimjar and his bets...
>Jimjar seems to LOVE gold. Has a gold nugget. He seems to be good on his promises as well. He takes every opportunity to make a bet. 

A few of the chains get unlocked but players leave them on as to not draw any attention from the watchful drow. 

A dark presence fills the room and [[Ilvara Mizzrym]] shows up...her guards take [[Ront]] out of the cell. [[Ilvara Mizzrym]] makes a big speech about who she is and what it means to follow her rules...or else. She never raises her voice, looks at everyone with eyes made of stone, and has a tone of pure evil. She takes out her [[tentacle rod]] to show off...almost admiring her weapon. Suddently, she wraps the tentacles around [[Ront]]'s head and crushes it. 

As she walks away, [[Lurrus Dreambow]] asks in elvish - 

> When are we going to [[Menzoberranzan]]?

She walks up to [[Lurrus Dreambow]]. Lurrus is stunned not simply by the evil spewing out of her, but by her beauty as well. She asks if he's in a rush to die to which Lurrus says "I haven't been in more of a rush". [[Ilvara Mizzrym]] grabs him and throws him towards one of the spider nets while laughing at him...[[Lurrus Dreambow]] making note of her prodigious strength. 

As [[Lurrus Dreambow]] tries to get out of the nets (after [[Ilvara Mizzrym]] leaves), he drops his knife but [[Jorlan Duskryn]] kicks it to move suspicion from him. 

At some point, [[Topsy and Turvy]] get taken so that they can massage [[Ilvara Mizzrym]]'s feet. [[Grumpy]] notices a key around [[Ilvara Mizzrym]]'s neck. 

After finding some weapons...prisoners start to plan their escape. 

>[!info] Sarith and Lurrus
>It is worth noting that their relationship is not good. Sarith is obviously hiding something but at the same time, is genuinely confused and therefore, even more mistrusting. 
>
>Lurris of course is mistrustful because he tried to talk to him but Sarith would not respond...also, he is a drow.

>[!error] Bad Dreams...
>It is worth noting that some of our players get really bad dreams...



### Session 2 - Prisoners of the Drow - Continued

[[Jimjar]] wakes people up with his noice, hes being busy digging away at the walls - he found some gold. [[Sarith Kzekarit]] tries to contribute to the escape plan by [[Lurrus Dreambow]] is not happy about. [[Shuushar the Awakened]] tries to get the group to work together. We learn that [[Prince Derendil]] is actually an elvish prince that was turned into a Quagooth. 

Besides more chores...our players are collecting more information about the place, the rooms, etc. [[Asha Vandree]] confronts some of the players about the escape plan...and helps them in their aid (for her own selfish reasons). 

![[638061931077149952.png|300]]

The plan is in action now. But people fumbled and the drow are alerted that prisoners are trying to escape...people running. Drow getting ready with arrows, no where to run. A few people decide to jump into the water, others jump onto spider webs and it is at this time...that a very loud buzzing fills the caverns - so loud that everyone is noticing now. 

![[638061932392542985.png|300]]

People get downed, spiders are attacking. After some time battling, part of the group makes their way to [[Ilvara Mizzrym]]'s tower. They get some special looking gems from the statue's eyes that can only be held by drow - [[Sarith Kzekarit]] holds on to them. 

In the middle of this, smaller demons start taking over the cavern battling anything in sight...drow and prisoners. More prisoners get downed...[[Grumpy]] manages to get a hold of the [[tentacle rod]] and throw it to his group - [[Lurrus Dreambow]] gets it. 

After a hard and confusing battle (and a very lucky interruption), prisoners go their own seperarte ways, with the majority going with our players towards the dark lakes. Others (including [[Jimjar]]) make their way to [[Gracklstugh]]. 

The players find a nearby cavern to rest after making an escape...players level up to 2!

### Session 3 - Into Darkness

![[ooa02-01.png]]

The Underdark is a vast network of tunnels, caverns, vaults, and passages stretching from one end of [[Faerun]] to the other. There are...fungus fields, subterranean rivers, deep groges, underground cities, yawning chasms....

#### Back to the Players

The players wake up to [[Eldeth Feldrun]] sitting, being unresponsiv, [[Sarith Kzekarit]] is getting angry and is trying to leave. Eventually, while [[Sarith Kzekarit]], an experienced dweller of the Underdark, assigns roles to each of the players to travel...[[Eldeth Feldrun]] eventually snaps back into reality. 

- [[Sarith Kzekarit]] will be our spearpoint navigator
- [[Zebu]] will be our surveyor

As the adventure begins in the Underdark...the players make note of certain features of the Underdark.

- no sunlight
- random dim lights
- alien-like
- endless terrain of randomness

[[Stool]] mentions he comes from [[Neverlight Grove]]. [[Sarith Kzekarit]] mentions he is also heading there (though he can't explain why) and that we are about 1 month away. For now, they decide their next destination is [[Sloobludop]]. While walkiing, various people do different things. [[Urimos Tusk]] talks of gathering food and eating, [[Zebu]] notices a source of light while also teaching people how to play "I Spy". [[Sarith Kzekarit]] is pretty determined to get where he needs to go and not stopping for a second...

The group decides to follow the light and are lead into a magical mushroom cavern...As people soon find out, some have good effects and others have a negative effect...

![[ooa02-03.png]]

After a few hours of gathering supplies and eating, they go on their way. [[Shuushar the Awakened]] explains that he was trying to instill his peaceful ways to his people...since there is always so much conflict. The religious opposition there has caused a rift and created a new group of followers that are violent. 

While walking, [[Lurrus Dreambow]] stumbles up against a group of what seem to be escaped slaves...but the scene he saw was violent, frightening, enough to cause him some level of madness. This group of people lost all sense of self...and seemed to have been eating each other. He decides to murder everyone...

As the group tries to get some sleep, [[Lurrus Dreambow]] struggles to sleep and wakes up [[Zebu]] and [[Urimos Tusk]] and notices his trap seemed to have been triggered....the drow have caught on. 

[[Sarith Kzekarit]] disposed of a 3 of them and loses 1...the group finally takes a rest. 

The group wakes up to [[Stool]] sensing a group of his people somewhere out there...There is a camp in which some myconoids are under attack...by a [[Dretch]] and a [[Balgura]]. After struggling a bit and [[Zebu]] going down, they finally manage to defeat the creatures. The Myconid survivors just sort of leave...without saying anything. 

Rest. 

### Session 4 

The group all have violent dreams...images of yellow eyes...the words "deep father" and "[[Demogorgon]]" are heard....

[[Lurrus Dreambow]], while on watch duty, takes the time to investigate [[Sarith Kzekarit]] a bit...and the rash he had been complaining about seems to be growing. He also hears [[Sarith Kzekarit]] whisper in his dream 

> I have to get to [[Zuggtmoy]]...

While on their hike through the Underdark, [[Shuushar the Awakened]] explains how the inhabitants of [[Sloobludop]] are split between worshiping "the deep father" and "Sea Mother". [[Shuushar the Awakened]] seems to be against the violent actions of those that worship the deep father. 

Along the way, the party comes across a group of injured humans running from danger. They were recently looking for a "lost tomb" and lost half their party to a group of [[Gnoll]]s. 

The group is suddenly attacked by a swarm of insects [[Giant Spider]]s. [[Zebu]] is downed and [[Erxus]] is taken by the spiders...though just barely, the party manages to survive. 

>[!info] Urimos Freezes
>Out of nowhere...as if driven by insanity, [[Urimos Tusk]] seems to have become immobile for a bit. 

[[Lurrus Dreambow]] questions [[Sarith Kzekarit]] on what/who [[Zuggtmoy]] is...to which [[Sarith Kzekarit]] doesn't know (he is being truthful as far as we know). 

There is a large expedition of Dwarves on their way to [[Gauntlgrym]] in which [[Eldeth Feldrun]] also ends up joining...leaving the party for now. 

There is a brief encounter with a [[Succubus]]. 

There is also an encounter with some renegade drows kicked from [[Menzoberranzan]]. [[Lurrus Dreambow]] takes the time to chat with them about [[Sarith Kzekarit]] and comes to learn that his name has been tarnished. He also asks if they know about his sister, [[Belinda Tremorbow]]...to which they point him to [[Menzoberranzan]]. 

After some time, there another dangerous encounter with 2 [[Grell]]s. They manage to down [[Sarith Kzekarit]], [[Zebu]], and [[Urimos Tusk]]. Eventually, [[Lurrus Dreambow]] destroys both and the team levels up. 

### Session 5

Mostly tired from the previous fight, our players hang around a bit, exploring the area. Mostly taking the time to learn about some mushrooms that grow around here...

![[uzv48ffbf7461.jpg]]

At some point during their travel...there are drow following them. After some quick thinking [[Sarith Kzekarit]] blows up the narrow path they were on to obstruct and slow down their advancement. [[Ilvara Mizzrym]]'s screams can be heard over the rumble. 

During their travel, the group accident falls into a lava pit and battle a couple of [[fire beetle]]s. Later on, they find a group of [[Gnoll]]s and a couple of dwarves...the dwarves come out victorious in this battle. The group realize they are also escapees from [[Velkynvelve]]. 

Finally, there is a long rest at the end of their travels and the group levels up...

A couple of [[Stirges]] attack the party and try to fly off with [[Zebu]], luckily, the party is able to fight them off and [[Lurrus Dreambow]] rescues [[Zebu]]. 

[[Shuushar the Awakened]] starts to share a bit more about his home...considering the group is about a day and a half away from arriving. They learn of the Archpriest, his faction, his daughter, and her faction - followers of the "Deep Father". The next morning, the party is ambushed by 8 [[Kuo-Toa]] and a [[Kuo-Toa Monitor]], wearing symbols of the demogorgon. [[Zebu]] understands them talking about taking the group as slave offerings and warns [[Lurrus Dreambow]]...prompting him to fire an arrow at the monitor. 

![[Kuo-toa-5e.webp]]

### Session 6

The [[Kuo-Toa]] group attempts to capture the group and throw their fishing nets at the party. [[Lurrus Dreambow]] is captured. [[Zebu]] does big damage to a few of the p[[Kuo-Toa]]s. [[Urimos Tusk]] cuts [[Lurrus Dreambow]] lose. 

After defeating them, the party interrogates them. They dont say much other than chanting _Leemooggogon_ over and over. They seem to be followers of the priestess, [[Bloppblippodd]] and the "Deep Father". The group kills them and goes into town. 

![[ooa03-01.png]]

The party meets the archpriest [[Poopploopeen]] along with some other [[Kuo-Toa]]s and the party explains what happened outside of town. They offer help but in exchange, they ask us to help overthrow his daughters cult. The party says they will need the day to think about stuff. Meanwhile, they learn a bit more about their lifestyle, the [[Dark Lake]] and how its filled with monsters. [[Zebu]] also recalls information about the [[Duergar]], underdark dwarves. 

They go... around town learning some more stuff, puking at the statue of the "Sea Mother" (out of respect). [[Zebu]] talks a bit more about the [[Thunder Daddy]]. 

> A nine-foot-tall statue stands here. Its body is roughly carved from some kind of wood in the shape of a humanoid female, its head and forearms formed from the severed head and claws of a giant albino crayfish. These parts are lashed on with strands of gut, and emit an overpowering stench of rotting shellfish. Shells, brightly colored stones, mushrooms, and rotting fish are piled at the statue’s feet and strung in garlands around its neck. Four stern kuo-toa slowly circle the statue, alert and on guard, while a few others mill about, gazing up at the statue and bowing repeatedly while chanting.

When they sleep, the party's dreams are filled with blood...The next day, the party makes up their mind to help the archpriest...so they come up with a plan to go as prisoners. 

![[ooa03-04.png]]

Finally at the Deep Father altar, there are many [[Kuo-Toa]]s bowing and "being weird". Priestess comes out and receives us as sacrifices. A [[Duergar]] named [[Hemeth]] is also going to be sacrificed. 

![[029-ooa04-02.webp|300]]

During a speech by the Priestess, the party breaks free and start attacking the [[Kuo-Toa]]s. As the battle intensifies...there are loud rumbles and trembles...until the [[Demogorgon]] comes out of the water and starts to destroy everything in its path. A lot of the [[Kuo-Toa]]s die, with their heads exploding, including [[Shuushar the Awakened]]. [[Hemeth]] offers to help by getting a boat ready to escape. The party tries to collect supplies before ascaping. [[Urimos Tusk]] gets caught by debris, but is able to get out. The party escapes through the south dock.

![[ooa03-05.png]]

> He will Rule the Underdark

is heard by everyone through the [[Demogorgon]]. Eventually, after much destruction and death, the party narrowly escapes while watching the [[Demogorgon]] lay waste to [[Sloobludop]]. 

### Session 7

They are on a boat...in the middle of the [[Dark Lake]]...still trying to comprehend what happened in [[Sloobludop]]. 

They are on their way to [[Gracklstugh]], luckily, [[Hemeth]] knows the way. Another boats starts to get closer and before the party gets a chance to react, [[Asha Vandree]] starts attacking them. [[Zebu]] is able to shatter their boat but [[Asha Vandree]] is able to walk on water while the drow try to manage. 

Just as things were getting heated...there is a third boat, but this one is friendly. It is carrying [[Grumpy]] and someone named [[Fargas Rumblefoot]]. 

![[Fargas_Rumblefoot_IC.webp]]

With everyones help, they take care of the drow on the boat. The group's boat is damaged during combat but [[Urimos Tusk]] is able to mend it during battle. [[Lurrus Dreambow]] eventually knocks out [[Asha Vandree]]. A drow caster is able to fly away and [[Asha Vandree]] is held hostage. A [[Ring of Walk on Water]] is found on [[Asha Vandree]] and [[Grumpy]] holds onto it.

The group stops at a nearby piece of land and get to learn how [[Grumpy]] and [[Fargas Rumblefoot]] meet. [[Fargas Rumblefoot]] ran into trouble while looking for _The Lost Tomb of Khaem_. [[Hemeth]] is an arms dealer. 

The party learns of _Brysis of Khaem_, a female wizard from [[Netherl]] - an ancient, floating city. It crashed into the underdark centuries ago when [[Netherl]] was destroyed. 

[[Zebu]] tries to get information out of [[Asha Vandree]] but she doesn't seem to know anything. 

[[Lurrus Dreambow]] tries to get information on Belinda and [[Asha Vandree]] is not caving in. [[Lurrus Dreambow]] reminds her that he is the nice one of the group...[[Zebu]] was ready to take at least 1 limb. [[Lurrus Dreambow]] and [[Grumpy]] seem to go mad...and start attacking [[Asha Vandree]]. She simply laughs and says they wont be able to resist the madness of the Underdark. 

![[02-01.png]]

The next day they head out and spot a [[Kuo-Toa]] on a boat. His name is [[Sloopidoop]], a member of the [[Society of Brilliance]]. No one really knows of the organization, but he seems friendly enough and provides information on [[Faerzress]]. The party informs him of what happened to [[Sloobludop]], but he simply laughs it off. 

### Session 8

It has been about 2 weeks since the escape from [[Velkynvelve]]. We know find ourselves evenly split between 2 boats. 

>[!warning] Sarith's Rash
>[[Lurrus Dreambow]] has been keenly observing [[Sarith Kzekarit]]'s rash and its only been getting worse. 

[[Lurrus Dreambow]] talks with [[Zebu]] to see if he may know of who or what [[Zuggtmoy]] is, be he does not. During this conversation, some nightmare is triggered with [[Urimos Tusk]] and he begins to seize and simply stands there, most of the party is oblivious to it except for [[Stool]]. 

[[Lurrus Dreambow]] hears the faint sound of a waterfall and everyone jumps into action to try and avoid it. [[Grumpy]] is enlarged by [[Urimos Tusk]] and puts on the [[Ring of Walk on Water]] to walk ahead and see what is going on...they are all caught off guard by a [[Merrow]]. 

The [[Merrow]] throws his harpoon and catches [[Lurrus Dreambow]] and brings him into the water...but the [[tentacle rod]] comes to the rescue. After this, the group makes a stop at a nearby island that has a little hut on it. 

After a series of bad rolls, [[Grumpy]] and [[Sarith Kzekarit]] are noticed by a [[Green Hag]], [[Nanny Plunk]]. 

![[636252778948574879.jpeg|300]]

She seems friendly enough and hands over some resources to the party. Before leaving, [[Grumpy]] shows [[Sarith Kzekarit]]'s rash to her and she simply laughs and says

> You haven't seen the worst of it yet

The group also decides they are taking [[Asha Vandree]] with them to [[Gracklstugh]]. 

They are traveling once again...in the vast darkness of the Underdark, in the Dark Lake. [[Grumpy]] and [[Zebu]] pressure the group to interrogate and hurt [[Asha Vandree]] while [[Urimos Tusk]] and [[Lurrus Dreambow]] rather not. 

>[!info] Underwater Trap!
>There are a few underwater caves the group notices and are able to dive down and get some goodies...but not before a mimic tries to hurt them. 

Eventually, the party starts to feel the heat from the metal smithing city, they ride past a statued engulfed in moss and [[Faerzress]], recognized to be [[Glitter Gold]]...

There is a nearby island and the group decides to stop for a short rest. Dreams of an orange monster and a mummy go all around....

The next day, when sailing, [[Urimos Tusk]] and [[Lurrus Dreambow]] hears a female voice...that no one else does...when suddenly, the boats begin to rock violently back and forth and [[Urimos Tusk]] falls into the water. An [[Aquatic Troll]] engages and quickly defeated. 

The voice keeps getting stronger and stronger...and [[Lurrus Dreambow]] yells out. Doing so causes more [[Aquatic Troll]]s to spawn and defeated ones to regenerate. The party eventually tracks down the voice to behind a stone wall, which the party breaks down to reveal a hidden path. [[Zebu]] and [[Urimos Tusk]] start to feel a strong magical presence. 

They come face to face with a giant bronze door. 

>[!info] Wild Magic
>Zebu is now forever blue.

A stone diorama stands to the right of the entrace, depicting the sorcerer [[Brysis Khaem]] as a Netherese noble in her prime. A vista of fantastic floating cities. There is a staircase going down....

Welcome to the [[Lost Tomb of Khaem]].

### Session 9

[[Hemeth]] stays by the boat to watch over [[Asha Vandree]] and [[Stool]]. [[Fargas Rumblefoot]] is very excited to explore the ruins. Lots of art on the wall ([[Grumpy]] notices there are many fresh scratch marks), the party lights torches and begins their descent. 

The first platform has a huge large ancient calendar, [[Zebu]] is able to notice more scratches. They descend into the next level where they find a marble altar and investigating, shows deity symbols, including the [[Thunder Daddy]] and one of a gold nugget. At this time, [[Zebu]] starts to talk about his very ancient religion. 

[[Urimos Tusk]] reminds us to keep a look out because we are still being pursued by drow. 

One of the rooms, there is a huge sarcophagus on top of a black marble altar. [[Fargas Rumblefoot]] comes in very excited and starts to point out the jars of organs, the art on the wall, but points out that this coffin does not look grand enough for it to belong to [[Brysis Khaem]]. With some effort, the party moves to the lid...

>[!danger] A booming voice...
>"You have disturbed the tomb of Khaem!"

There was no body in the coffin...just a stone effigy of Brysis. The party is also now cursed with disadvantage on attack rolls. 

Next up, the party enters a room with 4 sarcophagi, each places in one corner of the room. After someone rolling a NAT 20...they notice that one of the coffins is on wheels and can be moved out of the way...all of a sudden, a [[Spectre]] emerges and the party engages. As the party engages, there is still wild magic in the air...and [[Urimos Tusk]] triggers a fireball in the room with everyone in it...this instantly kills [[Urimos Tusk]], [[Zebu]], and [[Lurrus Dreambow]]. 

>[!info] Everyone has 2 lives
>Because of the nature of the campaign, I gave everyone 2 lives before they would have to make a new character...[[Urimos Tusk]] here decided to bring most of the party down to 1 life.

![[ooa02-15.png]]

After coming to terms with death and short resting, the party head into the final room. 

>[!danger] Another Booming Voice
>Your death will help me escape from this prison...

A black, smoky [[Wraith]] appears. After a tough battle, the party collects their treasure including the legendary [[Dawnbringer]]. 

The party is now level 4. 

### Session 10


[[Hemeth]] advices the group not to bring [[Asha Vandree]] into [[Gracklstugh]], that will cause issues...as the group sets sell to [[Gracklstugh]]. 

>[!info] Dawnbringer
>This is a sentient sword...[[Lurrus Dreambow]] is talking to it and is warned not to wield the tentacle rod, as it is evil. 

We get some info from [[Hemeth]] that [[Gracklstugh]] is not very kind to outsiders and is filled with invisible guards...and that the _least_ guarded area are the docks on the east side. [[Hemeth]] tells the group that [[The Ghohlbrorn's Lair]], in the [[Dark Lake District]] is one of the few places where outsiders are somewhat welcome...as well as the [[Blade Bazaar]].

[[Gracklstugh]] is a city mainly populated by [[Duergar]] and a small minority of [[Derro]], which has been a pain point for the city. The [[Deep King]] is the city monarch and the [[Derro]] seem to have an issue with him. 

[[Sarith Kzekarit]] mentions that [[Buppido]] is a derro and [[Stool]] still thinkings that [[Shuushar the Awakened]] is with us...

All of a sudden, the current starts to pick up and [[Asha Vandree]] is thrown overboard. [[Lurrus Dreambow]] fails his attempt to grab her and stumbles on some [[Water Weird]]. [[Grumpy]] and [[Lurrus Dreambow]] easily dispatch of them. 

[[Hemeth]] mentions that there are plenty of these in the area but that something must have triggered them to attack us...

[[Dawnbringer]] senses a change in [[Sarith Kzekarit]]...similar to the aura of the area...

![[ooa04-01.png]]

As the party approaches the city, they are greeted with an immense and overwhelming heat. Hot furnaces and loud clanking all around. [[Hemeth]] drops them off and hands them a map of the city. The party tries to quickly make their way through the dangerous city to the bar, [[The Ghohlbrorn's Lair]]. 

![[ooa04-03.png]]

The party gets there and has a chat with the bar keep, that warns them once again this is one of the only safe areas for them. It will be 100 gold a person to stay. [[Zebu]] starts challenging some of the locals in a drinking contest...which wins him about 500 Gold. They also learn about something called "Grackle-Lung"

>[!info] Grackle-Lung
>The constant smog in Gracklstugh causes grackle-lung in living, breathing creatures, resulting in persistent, wracking coughs and the spewing of thick, black phlegm. Whenever a living, breathing creature finishes a long rest in Gracklstugh, it must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On each failed save, the creature gains one level of [exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition) as its airways become increasingly clogged. A creature that reaches level 6 [exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition) dies, as normal.
>
>A creature with one or more levels of [exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition) brought on by grackle-lung must succeed on a Constitution check to take the [Dash](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DashAction) action. If the check fails, the action cannot be attempted. If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a verbal component, it must succeed on a Constitution check or be unable to complete the spell, causing the spell to fail with no effect. The DC for each check is 10 + the creature’s current [exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition) level.
>
>If a creature’s [exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition) level drops below 1, it no longer suffers the effects of grackle-lung and becomes immune to it for the next week. Duergar and derro are inured to grackle-lung, making Constitution checks against it with advantage. Any spell or effect that cures disease also cures grackle-lung, effectively removing all levels of [exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition) brought on by the affliction.

There is a necklace that dangles behind the bar keep with a letter, that [[Urimos Tusk]] attempts and fails to steal. [[Gorglak]] is one of the few that guards that come to arrest [[Urimos Tusk]], and [[Zebu]], and [[Grumpy]]. [[Zebu]] offers beer but he only accepts rare weapons as bribes. They are taken away....

The rest of the party makes their way downstairs only to realize the rest of their companions have been arrested and taken away. [[Lurrus Dreambow]] recognizes that necklaces and the letter is given to him...its from his sister [[Belinda Tremorbow]]. She was here weeks ago...no longer a prisoner and is on her way to [[Blingdenstone]] - a slave center but also, potentially a way back out to the surface. She is traveling alone. 

Back to the arrested group....

As they are making their way through a town, a stone giant seems to be going on a rampage in the middle of the city...[[Zebu]] is able to help by providing enough time for another stone giant to come and get things under control. He mentions that he went a bit insane after communicating with a stone in [[Cairngorm Cavern]]. The giant thanks him and suggests he goes to visit the cavern before leaving. 

As [[Lurrus Dreambow]] and crew makes their way to the hold, he notices some floppy ears moving quickly through the public...hidden. They meet up with [[Errde Blackskull]], captain of the stone guard. Gives us some info about [[Droki]] and how they have been after him. In exchange for helping her, she offers safe passage out of the city since she also suspects that some of her guards have recently become corrupt...She gives everyone badges that will help them move through the city relatively safely...

Some shopping gets done.

Back at the bar...[[Gartokkar Xundorn]] awaits the party...


### Session 11

We open up in [[The Ghohlbrorn's Lair]] where [[Gartokkar Xundorn]] and the party are talking. He asks the party to visit him at [[Themberchaid's Cavern]]. He believes the [[Gray Ghosts]] are behind the madness taking over the city. 

At some point, the party notices [[Sarith Kzekarit]] is missing. The party also comes across the [[Hall of Sacred Scrolls]] that has a magical door, in which they are never able to access. A [[Derro]] belonging to the [[Council of Sevants]] approaches them that they should leave and then disappears. 

While traveling throughout the city, the party sees a group of guards hauling slaves in cages...[[Prince Derendil]] is in one of those cages, heavily beaten. Being led by [[Gorglak]]. Walk near [[Lauduguer's Furrow]]. 

[[Lurrus Dreambow]] finds [[Sarith Kzekarit]] back in his room and interogates him about where he was. He shines the [[Dawnbringer]] on him and calls him useless. 

Downstairs, [[Lurrus Dreambow]] meets [[Grazilaxx]], a member of the [[Society of Brilliance]]. They tell him what happened in [[Sloobludop]]. There is a long rest that happens and [[Lurrus Dreambow]] gains a level of exhaustion...wakes up coughing. 

The next day, after some tense negotiation, the party buys [[Prince Derendil]] for 300 gold. He breaks down crying in front of them saying everyone else is dead. [[Buppido]], [[Jimjar]], and the twins. He knocks out the moment they arrive at the inn. 

Party attempts to cross the furrow and have to flash their badges, and they meet [[Stonespeaker Hgraam]]. [[Zebu]] is gifted the [[stonespeaker crystal]]. They head into [[Themberchaid's Cavern]] and come face to face with a dragon. He jokes that he will eat them and calls himself the father of the flame. 

![[ooa04-06.png]]

He asks the invisible guards to leave. He asks the party that he will be a friend to them if they were to report to him before anyone else on anything the keepers of the flame might ask of them to do. The party attempts to question him but he is immediately irritated. 

The keepers of the flame mention that an egg has been stolen by the [[Gray Ghosts]]. [[Themberchaud]] was supposed to be replaced by this egg at some point. They tasked us to find [[Droki]] and the egg. 

As they head into the ghetto...battles ensues, the party kill a few derro, they see [[Droki]] eating a mushroom to make himself smaller and go inside a tunnel...the party does the same and follow...

### Session 12

While following [[Droki]], [[Zebu]] and [[Grumpy]] find some guards with some bears in cages. They aren't very sneaky the [[Derro]] guards are immediately alerted and release the bears. The bears immediately attack [[Zebu]] besides his best effort of talking with them. He throws the magical rock to [[Grumpy]] which he doesn't catch...

Back at the lake, [[Lurrus Dreambow]] hands over the [[Dawnbringer]] to [[Urimos Tusk]] and the sword is happy to be separated from the [[tentacle rod]]. Scene interrupted by [[Grumpy]] being all bloody rushing in and they run to help [[Zebu]]. They are interrupted by some [[Water Weird]]s. 

A few more battles and tunneling...eventually, there is a letter they find that says

> **“I don’t need your poison anymore. I’ll deal with Werz Saltbaron myself. Bring me an elf blade, one with the swirlies carved on the steel, and I’ll forget you failed me. And I don’t want to see any of your goons near my post. The captain is poking around, and I could use a scapegoat.”**

The alchemist confesses to working with [[Gorglak]] and that he can be bribed. He is killed by the party, [[Urimos Tusk]] learns a few things and the party takes a short rest. 

A few more battles before heading out to the Darklake Docks.

### Session 13

There seems to be a lot of uproar in the city, [[Prince Derendil]] is feeling better but confused about everything that has happened to him. [[Sarith Kzekarit]] never came back...[[Stool]] mentions he has been able to telepathically communicate with [[Sarith Kzekarit]] without spore chat. 

The trouble the party caused in the ghetto is coming back to bite them. The [[Deep King]] has ordered the arrest of [[Errde Blackskull]]. [[Grumpy]] attempts to sneak into the [[Deep King]]'s hold but is unable to. The derro are restless. The party decides to go back into the caves to find the egg. [[Lurrus Dreambow]] and [[Urimos Tusk]] have a level of exhaustion. 

Another big fight in the tunnels, a few went down. The stone that was previously dropped wasn't there anymore. There is more trouble up a head...cultists and derro. 

Glowing green circle in the middle of the room. Something in a cage...

![[ooa04-13.png]]

### Session 14

The party kills off a few [[Quasit]]s as they enter this area. [[Grumpy]] made the first move and started battling 5 derro and a dog. The rest of the party join in to battle, including an [[ettin]] named [[Grula-Munga]]. 

This was a rough battle...but discoveries were made. References to the [[Demogorgon]] are all around. A letter saying the following - 

> Narrak — Need more scrolls! Stonespeaker Hgraam has traps traps traps. But Droki is wily too and very small! I can hear talk, and in talk they say names, and I hear names and write names and give you names so you give me time. But you have to give me more scrolls. Magicky spelly scrolls!
> 
> - Droki

The party went to a place where whispers from above can be heard...so they learned a few things. There is a plot against the king. 

Eventually, players went into an area with an obelisk. Dragon egg has been found! [[Pliinki]], a derro servant is seen here. Party killed him and stuffed him into a chest with [[Narrak]] in there as well. 

### Session 15
