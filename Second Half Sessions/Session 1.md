	- > Come at once to Gauntlgrym for an audience with King Bruenor Battlehammer, to discuss matters of grave importance concerning your experiences in the Underdark.
- if characters refuse, more insistant messages are sent

>[!notes] Gauntlgrym Connections
>This is where Eldeth is from. Being connected with her will automatically boost the reputation of everyone in the party. 

### Arrival
- welcomed when arrive at the gates of [[Gauntlgrym]]
- escorted into the underground city, through the [[Vault of Kings]] and shown to the guest quarters
- offered food, drink, and a chance to refresh themselves before their audience with the king
- treated with great dignity
- characters from other factions giving them curious looks along the hallways

### Events in Gauntlgrym

- chapter dominated by negotiation, social activity, and diplomacy
- characters have to listen to what the king has to say about going back into the underdark to find out more about the rising threat of the demon lords
- then characters must convince other factions to help them

 ### Audience with Bruenor
>You are taken to a mighty hall in which a red-haired dwarf of fierce and proud demeanor sits upon a massive stone throne, flanked by a number of guards and advisors. Although a long stone table has been set to one side, laid out with refreshments, there do not appear to be any other guests. “Welcome, friends,” says the king. “I’ve a mind to know about the rumblings and rumors about goings-on in the depths outside my city. If ye relate to me what ye know, we can talk about what ye might want to do next.”

- after listening, he might have questions...especially of the demon lords
- speak again at the feast later tonight

### Guests at the Feast

>[!info] BRUENOR BATTLEHAMMER
>The legendary Bruenor Battlehammer is a good dwarf and king, and always has the best interests of his people and home at heart. He is drawn to help characters who follow a strong moral and ethical code, and often seeks their help in return. Use his good humor and folksy demeanor to help endear him to the players. The more the players grow to like him, the easier it is for them to respect his advice and request — and to gain more resources and assistance from him in turn.

- at the [[Vault of Kings]]
- different representatives from the surface world of different factions
- seated at the high table with [[King Bruenor Battlehammer]]
- opportunity to know high members of other factions
- important citizens of [[Gauntlgrym]] are present
- If you want to add some intrigue or action, consider having one of the options from “Enemies Among Us” interrupt the feast, giving the characters an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities in front of their potential patron and allies. Rogue [fire elementals](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16861-fire-elemental) roaring out of the hearth or a disguised [assassin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16790-assassin) poisoning one or more of the representatives can completely change the scene.

### Bruenor's Plan
- after the feast winds down, servant fetches heroes to take to [[King Bruenor Battlehammer]] private quarters
- his previous friendly manner turned grave
>“I’ve told the allies ye met tonight what ye told me,” he says. “I invited them here to learn what is happening, to share what we know, and to get their backing for what it is I propose. Ye have braved the Underdark and lived to tell the tale. Ye know, better than anyone, what it is we face, but we need to know more.
>
>“The Zhentarim have a stake in a secret Underdark trading post called Mantol-Derith. If ye can get them on our side, they’ll guide ye there, where ye can meet with one of their agents, Ghazrim DuLoc. He can provide ye with a map to Gravenhollow. It’s a legendary place built by the stone giants long ago, said to contain all the knowledge of the depths. If there’s answers to be found for what has happened, ye might find them there. If ye are willing to go back, that is.
>
>“I don’t propose to send ye into the dark unprepared, and I hope ye make an impression on those gathered here so they’ll support our cause and your mission. From all I’ve seen and heard, there’s no one better to do what needs be done.
>
>“So, what say ye?”

![[08-002.bruenor-battlehammer.png|300]]

- provides honest answers
- [[Gauntlgrym]] has considerable space...as a reward
- titles, properties, products of the [[Great Forge]]
- too much negotiation lowers the kings opinion of the adventurers a bit
- next step is to bring the factions on board
- serve as brokers

### Enemies Among us
Even Gauntlgrym isn’t entirely safe, nor is it immune to the influence of the demon lords. During the characters’ time in the city, you can implement one or more of the following threats to challenge them — and to potentially disrupt their negotiations with the factions.

- One of the characters’ traveling companions is revealed as a traitor or succumbs to madness. This NPC secretly serves one of the demon lords and turns against the adventurers.
- If any of the party’s drow pursuers survived from the previous chapter, they might slip into Gauntlgrym and look to slay their quarry.
- A dwarf [assassin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16790-assassin) belonging to a demon-worshiping cult steals into Gauntlgrym to kill one or more of the faction representatives. Hoping to cast suspicion onto the adventurers, the assassin frames them as demonic agents.
- A [doppelganger](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16843-doppelganger) spy poses as one of the faction representatives and tries to arrange a private meeting with one or more of the characters, hoping to discover additional information regarding the looming threat. The doppelganger might serve a faction of the Underdark or a surface world faction Bruenor didn’t invite (such as the Arcane Brotherhood or the Red Wizards of Thay), or might simply be an opportunist looking to sell information to the highest bidder.
- Maegera roars within its prison, stirred by the madness and chaos growing within the depths of the Underdark. As a natural reaction to this new stress upon itself, the primordial spawns a trio of [fire elementals](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16861-fire-elemental) that attack the Vault of Kings, setting fire to marketplaces and unleashing chaos upon the dwarven residents. If defeated or somehow convinced to return to the Fiery Pit, the elementals dissipate peacefully and Maegera falls dormant once again … for now.

### The Way Ahead

Depending on how negotiations go, the characters are either an advance force to scout and soften up opposition in the Underdark while looking for valuable strategic information, or a diversionary expedition meant to buy time for the surface world to organize a stronger response. Faction representatives not impressed by the adventurers’ cause might return to their factions convinced that the characters have little chance of succeeding — or surviving. The others are confident that the characters can live up to the promise they demonstrated in escaping from the drow and the Underdark.

King Bruenor convenes a final gathering of his inner circle of advisors and the adventurers, giving the characters his thanks for their commitment to the fight against the demon lords.

> “Ye all know the dangers and threats of the world below, and have bought that knowledge with bravery and guile. Even more, in diplomacy have ye forged the first of the connections that will see the North prepared for what might come. If we survive the coming onslaught, we’ll have ye to thank, and no dwarf of Gauntlgrym will soon forget it. Ye all have the courage and conviction of heroes. Aye, I’ll even say ye remind me of other heroes I’ve known. From a previous life. …”
