A male [derro](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17378-derro), Buppido is surprisingly gregarious and talkative, demonstrating a keen mind and a disarming manner. This pleasant facade conceals the soul of an insane killer. Buppido secretly believes he is the living incarnation of the derro god Diinkarazan — an avatar of murder offering bloody sacrifices to create a path of carnage through the Underdark for his people to follow to glory. He rationalizes any setbacks (including his capture and imprisonment) as part of his “divine plan.” His killings are carefully ritualized, following an exacting process of cutting open the victims and arranging their organs.

Although mad, Buppido is cunning and capable of hiding his true nature to serve his own ends. Because he believes he is a god, he is convinced that he can’t be killed (or at least that the death of his mortal form means nothing to him), so he is completely fearless. He assumes everything is part of his divine plan, and enthusiastically participates in any plot to escape from the drow so he can continue his holy work. Buppido is happy to consider his fellow prisoners allies until such time as he no longer needs them, or becomes convinced that the omens point toward the need for one or more of them to be sacrificed to his greater glory.
