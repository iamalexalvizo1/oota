An [invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) [wall of force](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2292-wall-of-force) stands between the Deepking’s dais and the characters. Whether the Deepking is of a mind to fight the demon lords is up to you, although like many other duergar in the city, [Horgar Steelshadow V](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/273955-horgar-steelshadow-v) has been touched by the demon lords’ madness. Roll on the Indefinite Madness table in [chapter 8](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/running-the-game#IndefiniteMadness) of the [Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg) to determine Horgar’s flaw.

If the characters attack the Deepking, use the [knight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16938-knight) statistics in the Monster Manual to represent him, with the following modifications:

- Horgar is lawful evil.
- He speaks Draconic, Giant, and Dwarvish.
- He has AC 20 and wears dwarven plate.
- He has advantage on saving throws against poison, spells, and illusions, as well as to resist being [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) or [paralyzed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ParalyzedCondition).
- While in sunlight, he has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks that rely on sight.
- He has the Enlarge and Invisibility action options of a [duergar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16850-duergar) (see the Monster Manual).
- He wears [gauntlets of ogre power](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4641-gauntlets-of-ogre-power), giving him a Strength score of 19 (+4).
- He wields a [+2 warhammer](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/warhammer-2) instead of a greatsword: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage, or 11 (1d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage if used with two hands. While Horgar is enlarged, the damage increases to 15 (2d8 + 6) or 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage, respectively.

The Deepking’s royal consort is a [succubus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17027-succubus) in the guise of Shal, a female duergar. The succubus is a loyal servant of the demon lord Graz’zt (see [appendix D](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/adventures/oota/appendix-d-demon-lords#AppendixDDemonLords)). Her only task is to make sure no one tries to rid Horgar of his madness. The gown she wears was a gift from Horgar. It weighs 75 pounds and is worth 750 gp.

#### Development

If the characters expose the succubus as a fiendish spy and help restore Horgar’s sanity, the Deepking becomes friendly toward them and tries to set them against the drow, whom he blames for the spreading madness.
