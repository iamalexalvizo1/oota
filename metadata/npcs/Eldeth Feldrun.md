A female shield dwarf [scout](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17007-scout) from Gauntlgrym, Eldeth is high spirited and proud of both her heritage and her people’s achievement in reclaiming the ancient dwarven kingdom; she suggests Gauntlgrym as a destination to escape from the Underdark. Eldeth is stubborn and hates the drow and all other “corrupt dark dwellers” such as the derro and duergar.

Eldeth wants to get back home, but she is also defiant and self sacrificing — and therefore among the most likely prisoners to perish before getting the opportunity. If that happens, Eldeth asks a character she trusts to promise to carry word of her fate back to her family in Gauntlgrym, along with her shield and warhammer if they are recovered. This might win the characters the approval of Eldeth’s kin when they later visit Gauntlgrym.
