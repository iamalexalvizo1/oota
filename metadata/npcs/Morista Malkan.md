Morista Malkin is the only faction representative who currently resides in Gauntlgrym. Originally from the Silver Marches, she heard Bruenor’s call to reclaim the glory of the ancient line of Delzoun and followed him to Gauntlgrym. Here, she balances her work with the Emerald Enclave and her loyalty to her people and their cause. Stern and stubborn, Morista sees it as her duty to protect the people of Gauntlgrym from the often savage nature of the Underdark and to remind them of its natural beauty. She serves King Bruenor as an advisor and both admires and respects him.

Morista spends some of her time training elite scouts to reconnoiter the Underdark passages near the city. A few months ago, one of her scouts — a wood elf named Sladis Vadir — disappeared while on a mission in the Underdark. Hopeful that the characters might stumble upon Sladis and see him safely back to Gauntlgrym, Morista pledges a team of three shield dwarf scouts to accompany them, along with a giant lizard mount for each enclave scout and each player character. The scouts are named Brim Coppervein, Thargus Forkbeard, and Griswalla Stonehammer.

If the characters accept the Emerald Enclave’s support, make three photocopies of the [Emerald Enclave Scout](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/27720-emerald-enclave-scout) stat card at the end of this chapter as well as photocopies of the [Giant Riding Lizard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/26676-giant-riding-lizard) stat card (one for each enclave scout and player character). If you don’t want to control the scouts and giant lizards yourself, you can distribute their stat cards among the players and let them run the NPCs.

Should Morista come under attack, use the [scout](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17007-scout) statistics in the Monster Manual to represent her.
