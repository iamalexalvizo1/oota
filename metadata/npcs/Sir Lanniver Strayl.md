A devout follower of Tyr and a member of the Order of the Gauntlet, Sir Lanniver is the most respected figure among the factions in Gauntlgrym. Little surprises him at this point in his life, and he accepts what comes with a wry wit and an unshakable faith that things will always work out — provided those of good intent do what must be done. If most of the characters in the party are of good alignment, Sir Lanniver is supportive of their mission and wants them to succeed. However, a party of mostly neutral or evil characters will need to work to gain his support.

If he’s of a mind to provide aid, Sir Lanniver pledges five human veterans of the order to the party’s mission. The veterans’ names are Thora Nabal, Sylrien Havennor, Olaf Renghyi, Elias Drako, and Tamryn Tharke. Sir Lanniver can also offer a member of the party a [+1 warhammer](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5261-warhammer-1), one of a handful of treasures held in trust by the order. He prefers to bestow this weapon on a good- or neutral-aligned cleric or paladin. Feel free to swap this magic weapon with another magic item more useful to the adventurers.

If the veterans accompany the party, make five photocopies of the [Veteran of the Gauntlet](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/27718-veteran-of-the-gauntlet) stat card at the end of this chapter. If you don’t want to control the veterans yourself, you can distribute the stat cards among the players and let them run the NPCs.

Should Sir Lanniver come under attack, use the [knight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16938-knight) statistics in the Monster Manual to represent him. In addition to the veterans mentioned above, Sir Lanniver travels with a young but able squire (female human [guard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16915-guard)) named Rhiele Vannis.
