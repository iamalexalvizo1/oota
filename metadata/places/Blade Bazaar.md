This marketplace is named after the most abundant goods the duergar offer, but the shops here sell almost everything available in the city, along with stalls set up by visiting merchants. The din of people arguing, mostly in Dwarvish, nearly drowns out the hammering coming from the city’s forges, and the crowds here offer a good chance to slip away from pursuers.

Characters can unload some of the treasures they might be carrying. Nonmagical weapons, armor, and shields can be purchased in the Blade Bazaar.

#### Merchant Madness

Characters who look around the bazaar notice a number of odd things:

- A duergar merchant can’t stop insulting customers when they are trying to sell something, but becomes a picture of politeness when they want to buy.
- A number of duergar merchants give different prices to buy or sell every time they are asked about the same items, and insist that the characters dealing with them are the ones changing their terms.
- A duergar merchant suddenly turns [invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) in the middle of a transaction, but keeps speaking as if nothing has happened.
- A duergar merchant threatens to kill the characters as a haggling technique, then denies ever saying so.
- A duergar merchant constantly asks the opinion of a nonexistent twin brother, claiming that he is [invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition).

#### Ylsa’s Deal

Ylsa Henstak is a female duergar member of the Merchant Council. She’s a canny caravan master and prides herself on always arriving at her destination ahead of schedule. If the characters ask around for merchants who know how to reach the surface, they are directed to Ylsa. Though she has no caravans scheduled anytime soon, she does make the characters an offer.

Ylsa invites the characters into her well-guarded office, where she shows them a pile of coins and jewelry from all over the surface world. The hoard consists of 80 gp in mixed coinage, three gold rings worth 25 gp each, and two gem-inlaid necklaces worth 250 gp each. She has tracked the pieces to derro, who use them to pay for food. If the characters can figure out how the derro are getting surface currency and jewelry, Ylsa will provide the adventurers with directions for at least the next stage of their journey, including valuable advice on routes to Blingdenstone (see [chapter 6](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/adventures/oota/blingdenstone)) and the Wormwrithings (see [chapter 12](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/adventures/oota/the-tower-of-vengeance)).

#### Droki

Attentive characters can spot a curious figure darting between the stalls and shops of the Blade Bazaar. Every time they roam the market, they have a 20 percent chance to see a derro dressed in rags styled as an imitation of a fancy jacket, wearing a wide-brimmed hat with two tentacles from a displacer beast sewn into the hat’s crown. A large satchel hangs from his shoulder, and he’s always muttering to himself.

Duergar merchants glare scornfully at this derro, and none will discuss him with the characters. If a character asks about him in [[The Ghohlbrorn's Lair]], a successful DC 12 Charisma ([Persuasion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check yields up the name “[[Droki]],” and identifies the wily derro as a courier and supplier of goods who works for disreputable employers.

Catching [Droki](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17403-droki) (see [appendix C](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/adventures/oota/appendix-c-creatures)) is the objective of quests from Errde Blackskull (see “Overlake Hold”) and Gartokkar Xundorn (see “Themberchaud’s Lair”), but if the characters pursue the courier openly, he flees for the West Cleft District. Pursuing characters quickly lose sight of the derro as he vanishes into the crowd. See “Finding [[Droki]]” in the “Whorlstone Tunnels” section for more information on what Droki is carrying if the characters catch him.
