>[!info] Gauntlgrym- General Features
>Gauntlgrym is a city carved out of the living rock, with halls and passages wide enough for the largest dragons to walk through. There are hundreds of levels, twisting stairs, functioning elevators, and a system of mine carts crossing in and out of the central hub of the Iron Tabernacle. The players should feel their characters are in a place of great antiquity, poised on the edge of reclaiming its ancient glory. By no means is the city fully occupied. Indeed, given the relatively small size of Bruenor’s occupying force, keeping track of anyone within Gauntlgrym is nearly impossible.
>
>Light. In the upper levels and around the Iron Tabernacle and Vault of Kings, Gauntlgrym is brightly lit. Driftglobes, phosphorescent fungi, and huge braziers and troughs of burning coals fill most hallways and chambers. Lights in many parts of the city are dimmed somewhat during the nighttime hours, so that its residents can mark the passage of time on the surface world. In the lower reaches, around the Great Forge, light isn’t as ubiquitous. Farther down, and in parts of the city yet to be reclaimed from the ruins of the past, there is no light other than whatever visitors bring with them.
>
>Mine Carts. Mining was one of Gauntlgrym’s primary sources of wealth and materials. To facilitate the movement of ore, as well as the great quantities of stone used to construct and expand the city, the dwarves laid miles of track traversed by mine carts propelled by enchantments woven into their wheels. Even after thousands of years, the tracks remain largely intact and the magic of the carts has not faded. Where the carts trundle steadily throughout the city, Gauntlgrym’s residents use them for travel, hopping on and off along the system’s wide range of routes. While in Gauntlgrym, the characters can also make use of this convenient transportation system.
>
>All tracks eventually lead to a switching station in the [[Iron Tabernacle]]. There, posted operators manipulate levers and gears to transfer carts from one track to another.
>
>Ghosts. The shades of long-deceased inhabitants of the city, from the time of the Delzoun of old, haunt many of the tunnels and hallways of Gauntlgrym. These spectral remnants are seen passing through ruined sections of the city as if those sections were still intact, following habitual routes, engaging in silent conversation with one another, and generally keeping out of the way of the living. From time to time, the characters might run into a dwarven [ghost](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16871-ghost) who warns them away from a place of danger, or confront a less beneficial creature such as a [shadow](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17010-shadow) or [specter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17017-specter). King Bruenor has decreed the restless dead be left alone for now unless they cause problems.

- crippled after great battles with orcs...won...but at a cost
- eventually, over the next 1000 years, creatures from the underdark fought for the once great city
- The drow House Xorlarrin eventually took Gauntlgrym, establishing a new city they called Q’Xorlarrin, producing weapons at the forge that they traded and used to pay tribute to Menzoberranzan
