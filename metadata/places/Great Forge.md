The Great Forge is a cavernous chamber divided into smaller sections housing furnaces and anvils. Some areas of the cavern are raised on daises of stone, while others stand in shallow pits. Layers of stone catwalks crisscross the chamber, providing not only vantage points but also anchors for pulleys transporting buckets of ore and water throughout the forge. The Great Forge is about a half mile south of the Iron Tabernacle and several hundred feet below it, and can be reached by mine cart or on foot.

It was said of old that the Iron Tabernacle was Gauntlgrym’s heart, the Vault of Kings its mind, and the Great Forge its mighty hands. Here, on adamantine anvils blessed by Moradin’s priests, wonders were hammered from iron, mithral, silver, and steel. When Gauntlgrym thrived, the forge echoed with the hammering and songs of a hundred smiths working at once. In time, it might do so again.

It was the furnaces of the Great Forge that made this place the apex of the dwarf smiths’ art, for those furnaces are driven by the power of Maegera the Dawn Titan — a primordial imprisoned below them. Slumbering within the stone, Maegera exudes an unnatural heat that the dwarves tap into by winding coils of copper and adamantine throughout the forge like webs and using them as conduits to transfer magical heat to their furnaces. Runes of power carved into the walls and etched into the coils allow them to withstand the intense energy. Metals melt almost instantly in the furnaces of the Great Forge, and tools cast from those metals are enchanted with motes of primordial essence.

When Maegera awoke in the last century, the earth shook, and many of the furnaces’ conduits were severed. Today, lengths of twine-thin metal hang limp and broken throughout the rubble of the Great Forge, which lies upon the bones of those unable to escape the collapse of bridges and walls. Other coils remain in place, and the furnaces to which they are linked burn as hot today as they did in centuries gone by.

#### The Fiery Pit

Heat and ruddy light emanate from a pit in the depths of Gauntlgrym. Chambers and tunnels lead away from this chasm at different heights. Despite channels built into the walls to carry water to the magma below, the heat from the pit is ferocious. Gouts of steam billow up through cracks in the stone to fill the chambers above this area, and the earth rumbles in a pulse like labored breathing.

The Fiery Pit is the prison of the primordial known as Maegera, who slumbers fitfully in its depths. The only sign of the entity’s presence is a whirlpool of white-hot magma that resembles a great eye, set in the center of the lake of molten rock at the pit’s bottom. Maegera sleeps and dreams, half conscious of its surroundings and half delirious with whatever dreams haunt a being of pure destruction.

When the mages of the Arcane Brotherhood first tapped into Maegera’s power, they used water magic to bind elementals that cooled the primordial’s rage and kept it asleep. This bond lasted for centuries until the channels of water were closed through trickery by agents of Thay. With the pit’s cooling mechanism shut down, Maegera stirred in its slumber, and its dream of ruination was enough to destroy Gauntlgrym.

In the years following, Maegera groggily awoke from time to time, causing earthquakes throughout the region. Eventually, the primordial was returned to its slumber through the efforts of Bruenor, Drizzt Do’Urden, Jarlaxle, and other heroes. Where Maegera sleeps now, the intense heat it generates once again fires the Great Forge of Gauntlgrym.

#### Back in Operation

Under Bruenor’s watchful governance, the Great Forge has again begun to produce metalworks. If the characters are in the market for any metal goods (including arms and armor), or have any such goods in need of repair or replacement, the dwarves of the Great Forge are happy to help. No magic weapons or armor are available for sale, although damaged magic items can be repaired.

The king has left the day-to-day running of the Great Forge to a pair of experienced smiths: [[Helgrim Candlewick]] and [[Rollo Summergold]] (both shield dwarf [veterans](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17045-veteran)).

#### Great Forge Random Encounters

The Great Forge is always occupied by either Helgrim or Rollo, their apprentices and assistants (2d4 shield dwarf [commoners](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16829-commoner)), and shield dwarf [veterans](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17045-veteran) working in squads of six to guard the active furnaces. The characters might also encounter other creatures if they explore the unoccupied areas of the Great Forge. Check for such an encounter once per hour of travel or rest outside the protected areas of the forge by rolling a d20 and consulting the Great Forge Encounters table to determine what, if anything, comes out of the darkness. If the heroes call for help, four shield dwarf [veterans](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17045-veteran) arrive in 1d4 + 1 rounds to aid them.
