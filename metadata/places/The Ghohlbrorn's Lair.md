This inn is the only establishment in Gracklstugh that accepts non-duergar guests. “Ghohlbrorn” means “bulette” in Dwarvish, and the inn is built inside a small cavern complex beneath the Blade Bazaar at the northern end of the Darklake District. Its halls are cold and damp. A central chamber serves as a dining room, branching out into different small, twisting halls along which the rooms are excavated. It’s dark, cramped, and uncomfortable, but safe and defensible.

The general gist of the information is that trade routes out of Gracklstugh have become more dangerous recently.
