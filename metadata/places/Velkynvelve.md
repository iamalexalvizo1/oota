>**_Light_**. The interior spaces of the outpost are dimly illuminated by lanterns containing phosphorescent fungi, while the exterior is dark.
>
>**_Sound_**. A small waterfall pouring into the cavern creates a constant background noise, negating the cave’s tendency to amplify and carry sounds. Checks made to hear things in the cavern are made normally.
>
>**_Stairs_**. These 5-foot-wide stairs are carved into the stone sides of the cavern between several of the cave entrances.
>
>**_Bridges_**. Bridges of spider-silk rope connect the walkways to the guard tower and the entrance to the priestess’s tower. The swaying bridges are difficult terrain for non-drow.
>
>**_Falling_**. A creature pushed off the stairs, a bridge, or the edge of a platform must attempt a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature falls, landing in the webs stretched beneath the outpost. On a successful save, a creature grabs hold of the edge and hangs there until it can climb back up with a DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check made as part of its movement. A failed Strength check means the creature is unable to move and must check again, while failure by 5 or more means a fall to the webs.
>
>**_Webs_**. The dense webs of giant spiders kept by the drow conceal the outpost from below. A creature falling into the webs becomes [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition). As an action, a [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) creature can attempt a DC 12 Strength check to break free from the webs. The webs can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10, 15 hp per 10-foot section, vulnerability to fire, and immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage). Each foot of movement in the webs costs 1 extra foot, and any creature other than a spider that enters the webs or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 12 Strength or Dexterity check to avoid becoming [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition). Any movement in the webs attracts the attention of the giant spiders, which attack and feed on trapped creatures.

>A creature falling from the webbing to the cavern floor takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage.
