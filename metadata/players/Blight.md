Blight Immediate Backstory

  

Blight is a high ranking member of the Temple of the Thunder Daddy. He was the direct mentor of Zebu who fought valiantly and died at the hands of evil in the Underdark. Due to his ties to Zebu, Blight gladly answers the call for summons from the King for Justice in the name of Zebu. 

  

—- Extended Story —

  

Zebu’s family lineage is traced back to Delzoun after his death. Blight learns that Zebu left his home to pursue his interest in the Thunder Daddy as he did not want to become a smith or stone mason as was expected from a male from Delzoun. He learned of the Thunder Daddy through the Iron Tabernacle. In one of the many dilapidated cathedrals there was repeated mention of the “All-Father” who helped at one point in history to keep the Demon Lords at bay. Zebu deduced that through the years his followers have discovered his true name: The Thunder Daddy. So Zebu set off to reach the Temple of the Thunder Daddy on the surface and learn the ways in which the Thunder Daddy kept the Demon Lords at bay.

  

Along the way, Zebu found a disciple of the Thunder Daddy, Blight. Blight, who was an acolyte on his final test to become an Inquisitor for the Thunder Daddy, teamed up with Zebu to reach the surface and the Temple of the Thunder Daddy. Through their perilous journey together, they both became close friends. Once they reached the temple, Blight was promoted and a sacred ceremony was performed wherein Blight was imbued with the essence of the Thunder Daddy. The ceremony involves being struck by lightning as the Altar of the Thunder Daddy, a place where the connection to the Thunder Daddy is the strongest.

  

After his ceremony, Blight personally consecrates Zebu as an acolyte of the Thunder Daddy, a new responsibility/perk Blight gained as an Inquisitor. Once Zebu begins to move up the ranks through the years, Zebu decides that he is ready to rise to the rank of Inquisitor. The test of course being to survive the Underdark.  Blight is reluctant to give his blessing to Zebu to take on such an endeavor as he believes it is too soon. Eventually, as Blight realizes Zebu will not relent, he gives his blessing and wishes him luck. At the Altar of the Thunder Daddy, Zebu states his wishes to prove he is ready to become an Inquisitor. A sudden flash and Zebu has disappeared, transported to the Underdark by the Thunder Daddy. 

  

—---- Part 1 of the Underdark occurs —-----

  

Blight is suddenly teleported to Blingdenstone after Zebu’s death. He meets with Zebu’s companions and learns of what occurred. Blight learns that Zebu’s Holy Symbol, The Crest of the Thunder Daddy, is incorrect. A skull is featured at the center where the Altar of the Thunder Daddy is supposed to be symbolized. Blight begins to believe that the crest was cursed in the Underdark which may have led to his death. Blight begins to investigate this and finds that throughout the Underdark, images of the Thunder Daddy have been defiled to show this evil skull and pervert the image of the Thunder Daddy as an evil character. He needs to find out who/what is doing this and to what end. 

  

When King Battlehammer sends out his summons, Blight will answer to bring Justice to Zebu and stop the perversion of the Thunder Daddy.
