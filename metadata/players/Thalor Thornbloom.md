![[thalor.png|200]]
- Thalor is from moonroot glade. A hidden grove in the high Forest that recently became corrupted.,

- mentored by [[Liona Mossglint]], a emerald enclave member and ally of Turlong (legendary Trent guardian of the high forest),

- Liora went to find the source of the corruption but her messages stopped and has since gone silent,

Let me know what you think. I thought this was pretty good starting place.
